#Murder Arrest rate by state:

This application will give you a hands on way to investigate murder arrest rates in the United States in 1973.

- Simply check the appropriate boxes for the states you are interested in on the left hand side.  The application will then tell you which of those states had the highest and lowest murder arrest rates (pre 100,000 residents in that state).  It will also give you the average of the murder arrest rates in the states you have selected.

- If there are other states with the same lowest or highest murder arrest rate the application will output them to let you know, but will not include the unselected ones in the average calculation.  If you would like to add them to the average calculationyou can always simply select the new state.

Example:  If you select Alabama and Alaska, the application will tell you that Alaska has the lower murder arrest rate at 10, and that Alabama has the higher murder rate at 13.2.  But it also shows that Tennessee has the same murder arrest rate as Alabama (13.2).  The average murder arrest rate though is that of the states you selected, i.e. Alabama and Alaska (11.6).
